# DataStructuresAndAlgorithms

This repository contains implementations of various **data structures** and **algorithms** in **Java**. The goal of this project is to help deepen understanding of core computer science concepts by implementing these common data structures and algorithms from scratch. It is designed for **learning purposes**, and it covers everything from basic structures like arrays and linked lists to more advanced concepts like graphs and dynamic programming algorithms.

By working through these implementations, you can learn how data is stored, accessed, and manipulated, as well as how different algorithms can be applied to solve various types of problems. This project is a personal effort to build a strong foundation in algorithmic problem-solving and to strengthen Java programming skills.
